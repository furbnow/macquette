# My Home Energy Planner (MHEP) Django

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mhep-transition/mhep-django.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mhep-transition/mhep-django)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mhep-transition/mhep-django/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/mhep-transition/mhep-django?branch=master)

## Checkout the repo and submodules

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mhep-transition/mhep-django
```

Or, if you've already cloned `mhep-django`, run:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Install Vagrant & Virtualbox

* Install [Vagrant 2.0.1+](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

* Install [Virtualbox 5.2.18](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Run `vagrant up`

It should create a new Ubuntu 18.04 VM and configure everything.

## Start Django

With the vagrant box running, run:

`vagrant ssh`

Once connected to the box, simply run:

`make run`

This will start the Django server.

## Access MHEP

Browse to [localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)

An administrative interface is available at [localhost:9090/admin](http://localhost:9090/admin), the username is `localadmin`, password `localadmin`


## Design decisions

Here we document some decisions and principles we worked to while carrying out the port from
emoncms.

### Prefer static files over Django templates

Previously, most app logic was implemented in Javascript, but there were a number of places where
things were rendered by PHP. We almost completely eliminated this so that all data used by the
app comes via API endpoints.

The principle was to decide one way or another whether it's a backend (rendered HTML) app or
a frontend+API app.

There were 2 notable places we *had* to use Django template functions:

1. The `{% static %}` template tag. This is used by both HTML files (for imports) and by Javascript
   (for dynamic loading of scripts). For the 2nd case, we created `urlHelper.static(..)` - a JS
   function which hides the use of `{% static %}` in a single place.

2. The `{% url %}` (AKA `reverse`) template tag, for deriving the URL of an API endpoint. Again,
   we created `urlHelper.api.*()` functions to wrap and hide the use of Django's template language.

### Define relationships in the API (hide from frontend)

The *data model* of the app - the relationships between assessments, users,
organisations and libraries - is defined in Django's models, views and
permission classes.

The principle was to define this *only* in the API and try not to duplicate that knowledge in the
frontend.

For example: only an *organisation admin* can add or remove *librarians* to an organisation.

That's defined in the API. But how to render different UI to the user depending if they're an
admin or not?

 One approach would be for the Javascript to check if we're an organisation admin,
and selectively show the buttons to add and remove librarians.

But that would be duplicating the logic. Instead we chose to implement
`permissions` on the organisation list endpoint:

```json
"permissions": {
    "can_add_remove_members": true,
    "can_promote_demote_librarians": true,
}
```

This describes what the *current user* is allowed to do in that organisation - so the frontend
code doesn't need to understand the current user's roles directly.

### Frontend: prefer cloning DOM templates

In the absence of a modern framework like React, the app manually manipulates the DOM. This means
that code and presentation are mixed up and it can be hard to understand what's going on.

For the bits of frontend we worked on (e.g. libraries manager, organisation manager) we preferred
the principle of cloning templates.

Rather than outputting table rows like this:

```javascript
var myhtml = '<tr>';
myhtml += 'something ';
myhtml += '<button>' x.name + '</button';
myhtml += '</tr>';
```

... we'd define a hidden template row in the HTML file:

```html
<tr id="my-row-template" style: "display: none">
  something <button class="foo-button"></button>
</tr>
```

... then clone and manipulate it from Javascript:

```javascript
var newRow = $('#my-row-template').clone();
newRow.removeAttr('id');

newRow.find('.foo-button').html(x.name);
newRow.show()
```

This way means you can look at the HTML and more easily understand how the DOM is supposed to
look.


## Working with app versions

The app is fully versioned at the Django application level, with names like `v1`, `v2` etc.

Different app versions live under a URL prefix e.g. `/v1/`.

App versions are highly isolated, meaning each version has its own:

* templates & static assets
* URL schema (including API URLs)
* database models


### Starting a new app version

To start working on a new version of the app, cd into `./mhep` and run the script
[`upversion.sh`](https://github.com/mhep-transition/mhep-django/blob/master/mhep/upversion.sh)
and set the new version as `dev`.

The script copies an app version to a new version, for example, going from `v1` to `dev`:

* copy-pastes the whole directory `mhep/mhep/v1` to `/mhep/mhep/dev`
* renames the `static/v1` and `templates/v1` subdirectories
* adds the new `dev` app to Django's `LOCAL_APPS` setting and `urls.py`
* modifies the `dev/fixtures/*.json` files with the updated app label


### Finalising an app version

When the `dev` app is finished it should be renamed to e.g. `v2`.

Once an app is assigned a version number its code should never be modified again.
