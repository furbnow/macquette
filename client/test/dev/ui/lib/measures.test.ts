The most appropriate system will depend on a number of factors including the size and location of your house and its level of air-tightness. This system is suggested as a possible way forward, but further specialist design may be required to confirm this. \nNoise should be a criteria when choosing the model and the control method for the fan unit.the advantage of a centralised system is that the fan is contained within a central unit that can also be acoustically insulated and isolated. Ask your supplier or installer about noise as part of the performance of the system. \nThe ducts that carry extract air from bathrooms and kitchens to the central fan unit also need to be well designed and installed. Care should be taken to make their route as simple as possible and ensure they are not crushed or damaged. Rigid smooth ducts are likely to perform best - for efficiency, effectiveness, noise and hygiene. \nHow the boost for the fans is controlled should be carefully considered. This can be by simple attachment to a light-switch or a manual control - or via a humidistat or a motion sensor. Think about when and how the room will be used and when a boost is likely to be necessary. \nAesthetics and the level of disruption and disturbance may be a consideration for you, as well as functioning and cost.

You should consider carrying out works to these areas at the same time, for example by re-roofing and extending the roof over the insulation, or replacing windows and doors so they can be moved into the insulation layer.  \nThere will be a requirement for scaffolding, which may need permission from neighbours. \nThe current condition of the wall may affect the specification, and repairs to damp proof courses or pointing etc may be required before external wall insulation can be applied. \nAlternative finishes to render may be possible - e.g. tile hanging, timber cladding, rainscreen etc - but will  increase costs.

You should consider carrying out works to these areas at the same time, for example by re-roofing and extending the roof over the insulation, or replacing windows and doors so they can be moved into the insulation layer.  \nThere will be a requirement for scaffolding, which may need permission from neighbours. \nThe current condition of the wall may affect the specification, and repairs to damp proof courses or pointing etc may be required before external wall insulation can be applied. \nAlternative finishes to render may be possible - e.g. tile hanging, timber cladding, rainscreen etc - but will  increase costs.

You may need to carry out roof-strengthening works and you need to make sure your current electricity installation is to modern safety standards - or upgrade them as part of the work.. Maximising the amount of energy you generate that you use in your home will maximise carbon and cost savings. There are various ways you can do this - for example by trying to only run big appliances like washing machines when the sun is shining, or using a slow-cooker during the daytime. You should make sure the installer you use in MCS accredited.

Vapour open and hygroscopic materials should be used here to minimise moisture risks (e.g. woodfibre). \nThe installation should include insulation to all window reveals, including cills, and the insulation of ceiling to floor voids between storeys to avoid thermal bridging, which increases heat loss and also increases the risk of condensation and damp. \nGreat care and attention should be paid to air-tightness works - as this will both reduce heat loss but also reduce moisture risks by preventing warm and wet air from entering the wall build up.  \nThe condition of external existing wall is important, to ensure water cannot penetrate to back of new insulation. Repointing and other repairs of brickwork may be required, and it may be beneficial to apply a water-proof but vapour permeable sealant, especially in exposed locations - specialist advice should be sought on this. In some very exposed locations and with some existing wall types internal wall insulation may not be appropriate at all. Detailed studies of this may be required. \n',

Extending the roof over the depth of the EWI will mitigate the risk of water ingress.

Ideally you would remove the finishes on both sides of the construction - though this level of disruption may be unacceptable.  \nIn all cases the inner face of the construction, behind the ceiling, should be fitted with a vapour-control and air-tightness membrane.

Ideally it should also be fitted above or below the rafter to reduce thermal bridging. \nIf the rafters are not deep enough, it is possible to add timber battens or proprietary fittings to extend their depth. This could be done alongside any roof strengthening works that may be required if you are planning to change the roofing material or add solar panels either as part of this package of works or future works.  \nOn the outside face of the construction a low resistance vapour open membrane or sarking board should be fitted to reduce condensation risk and ensure wind-tightness. \nInsulation materials with greater thermal mass such as wood-fibre could be chosen to reduce the risk of summer over-heating in attic spaces.

This can be done from above or below, depending on access requirements and what other works are planned. \nDoing this from above as part of re-roofing without removing the ceiling below allows easier access to ensure wind tightness but may complicate the vapour control and air-tightness detailing. Done from below, without removing the roof covering, means it will be harder to achieve a good degree of wind-tightness. Ideally you would remove the finishes on both sides of the construction - though this level of disruption may be unacceptable.  \nIn all cases the inner face of the construction, behind the ceiling, should be fitted with a vapour-control and air-tightness membrane. Ideally a service void should be provided here to protect the vapour control layer from damage. \nInsulation should then be fitted between rafters. Ideally it should also be fitted above or below the rafter to reduce thermal bridging. \nIf the rafters are not deep enough, it is possible to add timber battens or proprietary fittings to extend their depth. This could be done alongside any roof strengthening works that may be required if you are planning to change the roofing material or add solar panels either as part of this package of works or future works.  \nOn the outside face of the construction a low resistance vapour open membrane or sarking board should be fitted to reduce condensation risk and ensure wind-tightness. \nInsulation materials with greater thermal mass such as wood-fibre could be chosen to reduce the risk of summer over-heating in attic spaces.

As the mains electricity grid de-carbonises, it is also starting to make sense in other homes. \nIt requires careful design, installation and commissioning to ensure efficient operation. It works best with lower temperatures for space heating - so oversized radiators designed for lower flow and return temperatures. Room by room heat loss calculations should be used to inform radiator sizing. \nThe position of the external unit should be carefully considered. They create some noise so it is best to keep them away from bedrooms and you should consider the effect on your neighbours. ',

You need to make sure that your roof is suitable. Preferably it should face south-east to south-west, not bebadly shaded, and it should be able to take the weight and the wind-load from the panels. You may need to carry out roof-strengthening works and you need to make sure your current electricity installation is to modern safety standards - or upgrade them as part of the work.. Maximising the amount of energy you generate that you use in your home will maximise carbon and cost savings. There are various ways you can do this - for example by trying to only run big appliances like washing machines when the sun is shining, or using a slow-cooker during the daytime. You should make sure the installer you use in MCS accredited. Accessing your roof will probably require scaffolding - so it may be possible to use the scaffolding to do other things while it is in place - from cleaning your gutters to major roof works to installing new windows and external wall insulation.

        notes: 'This is often over-looked, heat can be lost through convection at chimneys as well as draughts. The requirement for scaffolding likely to be biggest cost, so may be sensible to do when other works requiring scaffold are carried out. Cost quoted is per flue - there may be multiple flues per chimney. With a chimney filled with insulation there should be less risk of trapped cold air creating condensation problems. ',

It may also include sealing all service penetrations - vents, flues, waste water pipes, gas inlets etc - at the air-tight layer with appropriate tape, sealant or grommet. These may not all be accessible, so may be done as part of other related works e.g. internal wall insulation. It should also include fully sealing the junction with the external wall at windows and doors using high-quality air-seal tape. ',

Walking round your home on a windy day, with a smoke pencil or similar if required, should enable you to find the biggest draughts and seal them. A thermal imaging survey could provide a more detailed analysis. As you are making your home more air-tight, its important to also ensure there is adequate ventilation so indoor air quality doesnt suffer. Make sure as a minimum you have extract ventilation from kitchens and bathrooms. Follow the rule seal tight, ventilate right. ',
