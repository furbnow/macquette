MHEP will check the user is in an organization which name matches with the directory name, .html and .js files names.
Before comparing names all non alphanumeric characters will be removed from the organization name and made it lowercase.

Example
A user that is in an organization called "Carbon Co-op" or "Carbon Coop" or "carbon coop" will have access to a report in the directory "carboncoop"
