Your home is a mid twentieth century detached bungalow with filled cavity walls and a 21st century conservatory added at the rear. The windows are a mixed age variety of uPVC double glazing. The floors are un-insulated suspended timber throughout. \\n\\nThe gas combi boiler is quite old and of a non-condensing type, therefore not as efficient as current models, though there is a timer attached to it. Since you have only recently taken over the bills there is very little to compare the model\'s prediction of consumption with. You have said you keep the house at a temperature of 20 degrees. The readings taken for gas indicate it takes quite a lot to heat your property despite you not having the heating on all day.\\n\\nYou have identified the roof as a significant problem. A survey done when you purchased the property highlighted that work would need to be done to strengthen it. The roof line shows visible dipping. This will need to be assessed in conjunction with any retrofit work.\\n\\nThe model shows that the house at the moment would require 119 kWh\\/m2 to heat it to 20 degrees. At 21 it would be 131 kWh\\/m2 which is above the national average of 120kWh\\/m2.\\nYou are motivated mostly to save carbon, save and money and improve comfort in that order. It should be possible for you to make improvements in all these areas. To that end the following scenarios are tailored so that the 1st is low budget measures that one might expect to do to a house that has recently been bought. The second is quite a deep retrofit which would make a dramatic difference to the cost of keeping the property comfortably warm and dry. Finally the third aims to get your property to the 2050 carbon emissions target. Scenario 3 is an extension of scenario 2. \\n\\nNote: Since your conservatory has radiators in it has been considered as part of the treated area in this assessment. Normally it is not recommended to heat conservatories since they tend to be high heat loss areas. Generally they are designed to be used when the sun has heated them. In your case the roof and high levels of glazing make it an area of heavy loss in the model. However, the walls are of cavity construction and there is good double glazing and filled cavity walls between the conservatory and main house so you can consider it a little separately. But this is too complicated for the model to reflect. \\n\\nBecause of the above consideration with regard to the conservatory and because bungalows are inherently harder to heat high surface to volume ratio it is difficult to get the model to reduce the emissions by 80 percent without removing the conservatory from the heated space. Since you identified this as your most loved room we decided not to do this\\n\\nSince you have just moved in it is not possible to extrapolate a full years gas and electricity consumption from the readings you gave. Therefore there is no comparison for \\\"your bills\\\" in the report.  \\n\\nScenario 1\\n\\nThe first set of measures we propose are fairly simple ones that can be carried out quickly and relatively cheaply, with some immediate benefits. It may be that you carry these\\nout as the first step of a bigger programme, or as part of a bigger program of works. Most of these can be carried out independently of other works. We suggest you get someone in to carry out basic draught proofing measures. This will include the front door and the ground floor along with blocking up any unnecessary holes through walls. The full insulation of the loft has been included here. We would advise carrying out the necessary roof work before insulating the ceiling and adding storage space if required and an insulated loft hatch.  In this scenario we recommend replacing all the windows with uPVC type with A rated uPVC double glazed units, this is a relatively cheap option. Currently about half the light fittings in your house have low energy bulbs in. It would be good to do this throughout. \\n\\nWe recommend you have the chimney with the gas fire flue in it capped and filled with insulation such as vermiculite. \\n\\nThis scenario reduces annual space heat demand by over 10 percent with overall CO2 emissions reduced by a similar amount.\\n\\nScenario 2\\n\\nThis scenario is designed to suggest the extent to which you personally might go in a moderately deep retrofit of the property. It doesn\'t mean that you necessarily have to do it all or do it to the level suggested here but it gives and idea of what might be possible. It\'s assumed that you would do the loft spaces as in Scenario 1. \\n\\nWe have not suggested you have external wall insulation added here. The presence of cavity wall insulation means your walls do not currently perform that badly. External insulation would certainly improve them but the benefit vs cost is less compelling than if the walls were solid. Also you have suggested you may not be open to changing the appearance of your house externally, which would be necessary to achieve this. If you changed your mind, it would be possible to add external wall insulation at a later date. \\n\\nWindows and doors - Here the windows are all replaced with triple glazed units with a performance twice that of those proposed in scenario 1. We have suggested uPVC as they are much cheaper than timber and the age and character of the property means they would not look out of place. Timber triple glazed are available but at significantly greater cost - though you may prefer these for aesthetic or environmental impact. See the Carbon Coop\'s windows information sheet for a discussion of some of the pros and cons. \\n\\nFloors - We have assumed it would be possible to insulate under both the main house and the conservatory. Despite the sloping nature of the land there does appear to be reasonably good crawl height under the joists. For this reason we consider it a better option than replacing with a solid floor.\\n\\nRoofs - In addition to insulating the loft as in scenario1 we suggest replacing the polycarbonate roof in the conservatory with an properly insulated structure. Since you enjoy this space it makes sense to make it perform well thermally without compromising the qualities that you enjoy too much. This measure in the report does not allow for teh extra cost of replacing the roof altogether only for the insulation so that needs to be considered too.\\n\\nThe works needed for the above are moderately significant and would create quite a bit of disturbance. In some cases they can be achieved while the property is occupied.. The model indicates that doing everything as suggested could reduce the space heating demand for the property very significantly to 56 kWhm2 at a 20 degree internal target temperature. This represents a drop of more than 50 percent from your current situation. Emissions have dropped by around 40 percent. \\n\\nAs stated early these measures could be done in different ways to different levels. But some mix of all of them would deliver a good retrofit that would meet your needs. \\n\\nScenario 3\\n\\nThis scenario is aimed at meeting the 2050 UK government 80 emissions reduction target but does fall just short of that for reasons explained above. \\nIt includes the measures in scenario 2. In addition the external walls have now been insulated externally. The appearance of the property could be maintained by opting for a brick slip cladding rather than render finish - though achieving a satisfactory finish that really looks like brick may result in additional cost. This work should be done in conjunction with windows to ensure the best thermal performance. \\n\\nA solar electric array has been added to the roof. Super Advanced draft-proofing measures have also been applied - this would require more care to be taken in measures like window installs and floor insulation - but may also need \\n\\nThese additional measures further reduce space heating demand to 25 kWh\\/m2.per year at a 20 degree target internal temperature - which is comparable if not better than much new-build housing. \\n%\\n\",\"assessors_name\":\"Assessor\",\"assessors_biography\":\"\",\"houseimage\":\"\",\"1a_name\":\"A house\",\"1a_addressline1\":\"in a street\",\"1a_addressline2\":\"\",\"1a_addressline3\":\"\",\"1a_towncity\":\"a city\",\"1a_postcode\":\"a postcode\",\"1a_localauthority\":\"A local authority\",\"1a_conservationarea\":\"No\",\"1a_listedbuilding\":false,\"1b_housetype\":\"detached\",\"1b_bedrooms\":3,\"1b_agesap\":\"1950-1966\",\"1b_age\":\"unknown\",\"2a_tenure\":\"owner-occupied\",\"2a_lengthofoccupancy\":\"Less than 12 months\",\"2b_adults18to65\":1,\"2b_adults65plus\":1,\"2b_childrenlessthan5\":\"\",\"2b_children5to17\":\"\",\"2b_pets\":\"no\",\"2b_health\":\"no\",\"3a_roomthermostat\":20,\"3a_roomthermostatcomment\":\"not here long enough\",\"3a_TRVs\":1,\"3a_programmer\":false,\"3a_timer\":1,\"3a_cylinderthermostat\":false,\"3a_zonecontrol\":false,\"3a_boilerenergymanager\":false,\"3a_intelligentthermostats\":false,\"3a_remotecontrol\":false,\"3a_TRVs_comment\":\"\",\"3a_programmer_comment\":\"\",\"3a_timer_comment\":\"\",\"3a_cylinderthermostat_comment\":\"\",\"3a_zonecontrol_comment\":\"\",\"3a_boilerenergymanager_comment\":\"\",\"3a_intelligentthermostats_comment\":\"\",\"3a_remotecontrol_comment\":\"\",\"3a_habitable_rooms_not_heated\":0,\"3b_showertype\":\"Mixer direct\",\"3b_showerrating\":\"\",\"3b_shower_frequency\":1,\"3b_shower_flowrate\":\"\",\"3b_bath_frequency\":\"\",\"3b_kitchen_taps_num\":1,\"3b_utility_room_taps_num\":\"\",\"3b_bathroom_1_taps_num\":1,\"3b_bathroom_2_taps_num\":1,\"3b_kitchen_taps_type\":\"No energy saving feature\",\"3b_utility_room_taps_type\":\"No energy saving feature\",\"3b_bathroom_1_taps_type\":\"No energy saving feature\",\"3b_bathroom_2_taps_type\":\"No energy saving feature\",\"3c_extract_vents\":1,\"3c_intake_vents\":false,\"3c_trickle_vents\":false,\"3c_trickle_vents_comment\":\"\",\"3c_intake_vents_comment\":\"\",\"3c_extract_vents_comment\":3,\"3c_airbricks_comment\":\"yes\",\"reading_temp1\":22.6,\"reading_humidity1\":49,\"reading_temp2\":22.6,\"reading_humidity2\":49,\"4b_drying_outdoorline\":1,\"4b_drying_indoorrack\":\"\",\"4b_drying_airingcupboard\":\"\",\"4b_drying_tumbledryer\":\"1 emergency\",\"4b_drying_washerdryer\":\"\",\"4b_drying_radiators\":\"\",\"4b_drying_electricmaiden\":\"\",\"5a_past_location\":\"\",\"5a_past_severity\":\"\",\"5a_past_howresolved\":\"\",\"5a_current_location\":\"Roof structure\",\"5a_current_severity\":\"medium\",\"5a_current_howresolved\":\"needs resolving\",\"5b_loftconversion\":\"\",\"5b_extension\":\"\",\"5b_insulation\":\"loft insulation, cavities\",\"5b_windows\":\"all windows uPVc DG various ages\",\"5b_heatinghotwater\":\"\",\"5b_other\":\"Conservatory 2005\",\"5c_damp_location\":\"none\",\"5c_damp_severity\":\"\",\"5c_damp_duration\":\"\",\"5c_condensation_location\":\"south bedroom\",\"5c_condensation_severity\":\"mild\",\"5c_condensation_duration\":\"\",\"5c_mould_location\":\"\",\"5c_mould_severity\":\"\",\"5c_mould_duration\":\"\",\"6a_temperature_winter\":\"Too cold\",\"6a_temperature_summer\":\"Just right\",\"6a_airquality_winter\":\"Just right\",\"6a_airquality_summer\":\"Just right\",\"6a_draughts_summer\":\"Just right\",\"6a_draughts_winter\":\"Just right\",\"6a_problem_locations\":\"Dining room, master bedroom\",\"6b_daylightamount\":\"Too little\",\"6b_artificallightamount\":\"Just right\",\"6b_problem_locations\":\"Lounge\",\"6c_noise_comment\":\"none\",\"6d_unloved_rooms\":\"no\",\"6d_favourite_room\":\"conservatory\",\"7a_occupancylength\":\"Long term, more than 10 years\",\"7a_occupancylength_comment\":\"\",\"7a_lifestylechange_comment\":\"no\",\"7a_homeconversion_comment\":\"no\",\"7b_carbon\":1,\"7b_money\":3,\"7b_comfort\":2,\"7b_airquality\":\"\",\"7b_modernisation\":\"\",\"7b_health\":\"\",\"7c_local\":\"y\",\"7c_natural\":\"\",\"7c_performance\":\"\",\"7c_hitech\":\"\",\"7c_health\":\"\",\"7c_moisture\":\"\",\"7c_lowmaintenance\":\"\",\"7d_externally\":\"maybe\",\"7d_internally\":\"yes\",\"7e_disruption_level\":\"Move out for a few days\\/week\",\"7e_disruption_comment\":\"\",\"7f_timescale\":\"Within the next 3 -

have recently moved into the property and are hoping to make it your home for some time. Your home is a mid twentieth century detached bungalow with filled cavity walls and a 21st century conservatory added at the rear. The windows are a mixed age variety of uPVC double glazing. The floors are un-insulated suspended timber throughout. \\n\\nThe gas combi boiler is quite old and of a non-condensing type, therefore not as efficient as current models, though there is a timer attached to it. Since you have only recently taken over the bills there is very little to compare the model\'s prediction of consumption with. You have said you keep the house at a temperature of 20 degrees. The readings taken for gas indicate it takes quite a lot to heat your property despite you not having the heating on all day.\\n\\nYou have identified the roof as a significant problem. A survey done when you purchased the property highlighted that work would need to be done to strengthen it. The roof line shows visible dipping. This will need to be assessed in conjunction with any retrofit work.\\n\\nThe model shows that the house at the moment would require 119 kWh\\/m2 to heat it to 20 degrees. At 21 it would be 131 kWh\\/m2 which is above the national average of 120kWh\\/m2.\\nYou are motivated mostly to save carbon, save and money and improve comfort in that order. It should be possible for you to make improvements in all these areas. To that end the following scenarios are tailored so that the 1st is low budget measures that one might expect to do to a house that has recently been bought. The second is quite a deep retrofit which would make a dramatic difference to the cost of keeping the property comfortably warm and dry. Finally the third aims to get your property to the 2050 carbon emissions target. Scenario 3 is an extension of scenario 2. \\n\\nNote: Since your conservatory has radiators in it has been considered as part of the treated area in this assessment. Normally it is not recommended to heat conservatories since they tend to be high heat loss areas. Generally they are designed to be used when the sun has heated them. In your case the roof and high levels of glazing make it an area of heavy loss in the model. However, the walls are of cavity construction and there is good double glazing and filled cavity walls between the conservatory and main house so you can consider it a little separately. But this is too complicated for the model to reflect. \\n\\nBecause of the above consideration with regard to the conservatory and because bungalows are inherently harder to heat high surface to volume ratio it is difficult to get the model to reduce the emissions by 80 percent without removing the conservatory from the heated space. Since you identified this as your most loved room we decided not to do this\\n\\nSince you have just moved in it is not possible to extrapolate a full years gas and electricity consumption from the readings you gave. Therefore there is no comparison for \\\"your bills\\\" in the report.  \\n\\nScenario 1\\n\\nThe first set of measures we propose are fairly simple ones that can be carried out quickly and relatively cheaply, with some immediate benefits. It may be that you carry these\\nout as the first step of a bigger programme, or as part of a bigger program of works. Most of these can be carried out independently of other works. We suggest you get someone in to carry out basic draught proofing measures. This will include the front door and the ground floor along with blocking up any unnecessary holes through walls. The full insulation of the loft has been included here. We would advise carrying out the necessary roof work before insulating the ceiling and adding storage space if required and an insulated loft hatch.  In this scenario we recommend replacing all the windows with uPVC type with A rated uPVC double glazed units, this is a relatively cheap option. Currently about half the light fittings in your house have low energy bulbs in. It would be good to do this throughout. \\n\\nWe recommend you have the chimney with the gas fire flue in it capped and filled with insulation such as vermiculite. \\n\\nThis scenario reduces annual space heat demand by over 10 percent with overall CO2 emissions reduced by a similar amount.\\n\\nScenario 2\\n\\nThis scenario is designed to suggest the extent to which you personally might go in a moderately deep retrofit of the property. It doesn\'t mean that you necessarily have to do it all or do it to the level suggested here but it gives and idea of what might be possible. It\'s assumed that you would do the loft spaces as in Scenario 1. \\n\\nWe have not suggested you have external wall insulation added here. The presence of cavity wall insulation means your walls do not currently perform that badly. External insulation would certainly improve them but the benefit vs cost is less compelling than if the walls were solid. Also you have suggested you may not be open to changing the appearance of your house externally, which would be necessary to achieve this. If you changed your mind, it would be possible to add external wall insulation at a later date. \\n\\nWindows and doors - Here the windows are all replaced with triple glazed units with a performance twice that of those proposed in scenario 1. We have suggested uPVC as they are much cheaper than timber and the age and character of the property means they would not look out of place. Timber triple glazed are available but at significantly greater cost - though you may prefer these for aesthetic or environmental impact. See the Carbon Coop\'s windows information sheet for a discussion of some of the pros and cons. \\n\\nFloors - We have assumed it would be possible to insulate under both the main house and the conservatory. Despite the sloping nature of the land there does appear to be reasonably good crawl height under the joists. For this reason we consider it a better option than replacing with a solid floor.\\n\\nRoofs - In addition to insulating the loft as in scenario1 we suggest replacing the polycarbonate roof in the conservatory with an properly insulated structure. Since you enjoy this space it makes sense to make it perform well thermally without compromising the qualities that you enjoy too much. This measure in the report does not allow for teh extra cost of replacing the roof altogether only for the insulation so that needs to be considered too.\\n\\nThe works needed for the above are moderately significant and would create quite a bit of disturbance. In some cases they can be achieved while the property is occupied.. The model indicates that doing everything as suggested could reduce the space heating demand for the property very significantly to 56 kWhm2 at a 20 degree internal target temperature. This represents a drop of more than 50 percent from your current situation. Emissions have dropped by around 40 percent. \\n\\nAs stated early these measures could be done in different ways to different levels. But some mix of all of them would deliver a good retrofit that would meet your needs. \\n\\nScenario 3\\n\\nThis scenario is aimed at meeting the 2050 UK government 80 emissions reduction target but does fall just short of that for reasons explained above. \\nIt includes the measures in scenario 2. In addition the external walls have now been insulated externally. The appearance of the property could be maintained by opting for a brick slip cladding rather than render finish - though achieving a satisfactory finish that really looks like brick may result in additional cost. This work should be done in conjunction with windows to ensure the best thermal performance. \\n\\nA solar electric array has been added to the roof.

Your home is a mid twentieth century detached bungalow with filled cavity walls and a 21st century conservatory added at the rear. The windows are a mixed age variety of uPVC double glazing. The floors are un-insulated suspended timber throughout. \\n\\nThe gas combi boiler is quite old and of a non-condensing type, therefore not as efficient as current models, though there is a timer attached to it. Since you have only recently taken over the bills there is very little to compare the model\'s prediction of consumption with. You have said you keep the house at a temperature of 20 degrees. The readings taken for gas indicate it takes quite a lot to heat your property despite you not having the heating on all day.\\n\\nYou have identified the roof as a significant problem. A survey done when you purchased the property highlighted that work would need to be done to strengthen it. The roof line shows visible dipping. This will need to be assessed in conjunction with any retrofit work.\\n\\nThe model shows that the house at the moment would require 119 kWh\\/m2 to heat it to 20 degrees. At 21 it would be 131 kWh\\/m2 which is above the national average of 120kWh\\/m2.\\nYou are motivated mostly to save carbon, save and money and improve comfort in that order. It should be possible for you to make improvements in all these areas. To that end the following scenarios are tailored so that the 1st is low budget measures that one might expect to do to a house that has recently been bought. The second is quite a deep retrofit which would make a dramatic difference to the cost of keeping the property comfortably warm and dry. Finally the third aims to get your property to the 2050 carbon emissions target. Scenario 3 is an extension of scenario 2. \\n\\nNote: Since your conservatory has radiators in it has been considered as part of the treated area in this assessment. Normally it is not recommended to heat conservatories since they tend to be high heat loss areas. Generally they are designed to be used when the sun has heated them. In your case the roof and high levels of glazing make it an area of heavy loss in the model. However, the walls are of cavity construction and there is good double glazing and filled cavity walls between the conservatory and main house so you can consider it a little separately. But this is too complicated for the model to reflect. \\n\\nBecause of the above consideration with regard to the conservatory and because bungalows are inherently harder to heat high surface to volume ratio it is difficult to get the model to reduce the emissions by 80 percent without removing the conservatory from the heated space. Since you identified this as your most loved room we decided not to do this\\n\\nSince you have just moved in it is not possible to extrapolate a full years gas and electricity consumption from the readings you gave. Therefore there is no comparison for \\\"your bills\\\" in the report.  \\n\\nScenario 1\\n\\nThe first set of measures we propose are fairly simple ones that can be carried out quickly and relatively cheaply, with some immediate benefits. It may be that you carry these\\nout as the first step of a bigger programme, or as part of a bigger program of works. Most of these can be carried out independently of other works. We suggest you get someone in to carry out basic draught proofing measures. This will include the front door and the ground floor along with blocking up any unnecessary holes through walls. The full insulation of the loft has been included here. We would advise carrying out the necessary roof work before insulating the ceiling and adding storage space if required and an insulated loft hatch.  In this scenario we recommend replacing all the windows with uPVC type with A rated uPVC double glazed units, this is a relatively cheap option. Currently about half the light fittings in your house have low energy bulbs in. It would be good to do this throughout. \\n\\nWe recommend you have the chimney with the gas fire flue in it capped and filled with insulation such as vermiculite. \\n\\nThis scenario reduces annual space heat demand by over 10 percent with overall CO2 emissions reduced by a similar amount.\\n\\nScenario 2\\n\\nThis scenario is designed to suggest the extent to which you personally might go in a moderately deep retrofit of the property. It doesn\'t mean that you necessarily have to do it all or do it to the level suggested here but it gives and idea of what might be possible. It\'s assumed that you would do the loft spaces as in Scenario 1. \\n\\nWe have not suggested you have external wall insulation added here. The presence of cavity wall insulation means your walls do not currently perform that badly. External insulation would certainly improve them but the benefit vs cost is less compelling than if the walls were solid. Also you have suggested you may not be open to changing the appearance of your house externally, which would be necessary to achieve this. If you changed your mind, it would be possible to add external wall insulation at a later date. \\n\\nWindows and doors - Here the windows are all replaced with triple glazed units with a performance twice that of those proposed in scenario 1. We have suggested uPVC as they are much cheaper than timber and the age and character of the property means they would not look out of place. Timber triple glazed are available but at significantly greater cost - though you may prefer these for aesthetic or environmental impact. See the Carbon Coop\'s windows information sheet for a discussion of some of the pros and cons. \\n\\nFloors - We have assumed it would be possible to insulate under both the main house and the conservatory. Despite the sloping nature of the land there does appear to be reasonably good crawl height under the joists. For this reason we consider it a better option than replacing with a solid floor.\\n\\nRoofs - In addition to insulating the loft as in scenario1 we suggest replacing the polycarbonate roof in the conservatory with an properly insulated structure. Since you enjoy this space it makes sense to make it perform well thermally without compromising the qualities that you enjoy too much. This measure in the report does not allow for teh extra cost of replacing the roof altogether only for the insulation so that needs to be considered too.\\n\\nThe works needed for the above are moderately significant and would create quite a bit of disturbance. In some cases they can be achieved while the property is occupied.. The model indicates that doing everything as suggested could reduce the space heating demand for the property very significantly to 56 kWhm2 at a 20 degree internal target temperature. This represents a drop of more than 50 percent from your current situation. Emissions have dropped by around 40 percent. \\n\\nAs stated early these measures could be done in different ways to different levels. But some mix of all of them would deliver a good retrofit that would meet your needs. \\n\\nScenario 3\\n\\nThis scenario is aimed at meeting the 2050 UK government 80 emissions reduction target but does fall just short of that for reasons explained above. \\nIt includes the measures in scenario 2. In addition the external walls have now been insulated externally. The appearance of the property could be maintained by opting for a brick slip cladding rather than render finish - though achieving a satisfactory finish that really looks like brick may result in additional cost. This work should be done in conjunction with windows to ensure the best thermal performance. \\n\\nA solar electric array has been added to the roof. Super Advanced draft-proofing measures have also been applied - this would require more care to be taken in measures like window installs and floor insulation - but may also need \\n\\nThese additional measures further reduce space heating demand to 25 kWh\\/m2.per year at a 20 degree target internal temperature - which is comparable if not better than much new-build housing. \\n%\\n\",\"assessors_name\":\"Assessor\",\"assessors_biography\":\"\",\"houseimage\":\"\",\"1a_name\":\"A house\",\"1a_addressline1\":\"in a street\",\"1a_addressline2\":\"\",\"1a_addressline3\":\"\",\"1a_towncity\":\"a city\",\"1a_postcode\":\"a postcode\",\"1a_localauthority\":\"A local authority\",\"1a_conservationarea\":\"No\",\"1a_listedbuilding\":false,\"1b_housetype\":\"detached\",\"1b_bedrooms\":3,\"1b_agesap\":\"1950-1966\",\"1b_age\":\"unknown\",\"2a_tenure\":\"owner-occupied\",\"2a_lengthofoccupancy\":\"Less than 12 months\",\"2b_adults18to65\":1,\"2b_adults65plus\":1,\"2b_childrenlessthan5\":\"\",\"2b_children5to17\":\"\",\"2b_pets\":\"no\",\"2b_health\":\"no\",\"3a_roomthermostat\":20,\"3a_roomthermostatcomment\":\"not here long enough\",\"3a_TRVs\":1,\"3a_programmer\":false,\"3a_timer\":1,\"3a_cylinderthermostat\":false,\"3a_zonecontrol\":false,\"3a_boilerenergymanager\":false,\"3a_intelligentthermostats\":false,\"3a_remotecontrol\":false,\"3a_TRVs_comment\":\"\",\"3a_programmer_comment\":\"\",\"3a_timer_comment\":\"\",\"3a_cylinderthermostat_comment\":\"\",\"3a_zonecontrol_comment\":\"\",\"3a_boilerenergymanager_comment\":\"\",\"3a_intelligentthermostats_comment\":\"\",\"3a_remotecontrol_comment\":\"\",\"3a_habitable_rooms_not_heated\":0,\"3b_showertype\":\"Mixer direct\",\"3b_showerrating\":\"\",\"3b_shower_frequency\":1,\"3b_shower_flowrate\":\"\",\"3b_bath_frequency\":\"\",\"3b_kitchen_taps_num\":1,\"3b_utility_room_taps_num\":\"\",\"3b_bathroom_1_taps_num\":1,\"3b_bathroom_2_taps_num\":1,\"3b_kitchen_taps_type\":\"No energy saving feature\",\"3b_utility_room_taps_type\":\"No energy saving feature\",\"3b_bathroom_1_taps_type\":\"No energy saving feature\",\"3b_bathroom_2_taps_type\":\"No energy saving feature\",\"3c_extract_vents\":1,\"3c_intake_vents\":false,\"3c_trickle_vents\":false,\"3c_trickle_vents_comment\":\"\",\"3c_intake_vents_comment\":\"\",\"3c_extract_vents_comment\":3,\"3c_airbricks_comment\":\"yes\",\"reading_temp1\":22.6,\"reading_humidity1\":49,\"reading_temp2\":22.6,\"reading_humidity2\":49,\"4b_drying_outdoorline\":1,\"4b_drying_indoorrack\":\"\",\"4b_drying_airingcupboard\":\"\",\"4b_drying_tumbledryer\":\"1 emergency\",\"4b_drying_washerdryer\":\"\",\"4b_drying_radiators\":\"\",\"4b_drying_electricmaiden\":\"\",\"5a_past_location\":\"\",\"5a_past_severity\":\"\",\"5a_past_howresolved\":\"\",\"5a_current_location\":\"Roof structure\",\"5a_current_severity\":\"medium\",\"5a_current_howresolved\":\"needs resolving\",\"5b_loftconversion\":\"\",\"5b_extension\":\"\",\"5b_insulation\":\"loft insulation, cavities\",\"5b_windows\":\"all windows uPVc DG various ages\",\"5b_heatinghotwater\":\"\",\"5b_other\":\"Conservatory 2005\",\"5c_damp_location\":\"none\",\"5c_damp_severity\":\"\",\"5c_damp_duration\":\"\",\"5c_condensation_location\":\"south bedroom\",\"5c_condensation_severity\":\"mild\",\"5c_condensation_duration\":\"\",\"5c_mould_location\":\"\",\"5c_mould_severity\":\"\",\"5c_mould_duration\":\"\",\"6a_temperature_winter\":\"Too cold\",\"6a_temperature_summer\":\"Just right\",\"6a_airquality_winter\":\"Just right\",\"6a_airquality_summer\":\"Just right\",\"6a_draughts_summer\":\"Just right\",\"6a_draughts_winter\":\"Just right\",\"6a_problem_locations\":\"Dining room, master bedroom\",\"6b_daylightamount\":\"Too little\",\"6b_artificallightamount\":\"Just right\",\"6b_problem_locations\":\"Lounge\",\"6c_noise_comment\":\"none\",\"6d_unloved_rooms\":\"no\",\"6d_favourite_room\":\"conservatory\",\"7a_occupancylength\":\"Long term, more than 10 years\",\"7a_occupancylength_comment\":\"\",\"7a_lifestylechange_comment\":\"no\",\"7a_homeconversion_comment\":\"no\",\"7b_carbon\":1,\"7b_money\":3,\"7b_comfort\":2,\"7b_airquality\":\"\",\"7b_modernisation\":\"\",\"7b_health\":\"\",\"7c_local\":\"y\",\"7c_natural\":\"\",\"7c_performance\":\"\",\"7c_hitech\":\"\",\"7c_health\":\"\",\"7c_moisture\":\"\",\"7c_lowmaintenance\":\"\",\"7d_externally\":\"maybe\",\"7d_internally\":\"yes\",\"7e_disruption_level\":\"Move out for a few days\\/week\",\"7e_disruption_comment\":\"\",\"7f_timescale\":\"Within the next 3 -

Your home is a mid twentieth century detached bungalow with filled cavity walls and a 21st century conservatory added at the rear. The windows are a mixed age variety of uPVC double glazing. The floors are un-insulated suspended timber throughout. \\n\\nThe gas combi boiler is quite old and of a non-condensing type, therefore not as efficient as current models, though there is a timer attached to it. Since you have only recently taken over the bills there is very little to compare the model\'s prediction of consumption with. You have said you keep the house at a temperature of 20 degrees. The readings taken for gas indicate it takes quite a lot to heat your property despite you not having the heating on all day.\\n\\nYou have identified the roof as a significant problem. A survey done when you purchased the property highlighted that work would need to be done to strengthen it. The roof line shows visible dipping. This will need to be assessed in conjunction with any retrofit work.\\n\\nThe model shows that the house at the moment would require 119 kWh\\/m2 to heat it to 20 degrees. At 21 it would be 131 kWh\\/m2 which is above the national average of 120kWh\\/m2.\\nYou are motivated mostly to save carbon, save and money and improve comfort in that order. It should be possible for you to make improvements in all these areas. To that end the following scenarios are tailored so that the 1st is low budget measures that one might expect to do to a house that has recently been bought. The second is quite a deep retrofit which would make a dramatic difference to the cost of keeping the property comfortably warm and dry. Finally the third aims to get your property to the 2050 carbon emissions target. Scenario 3 is an extension of scenario 2. \\n\\nNote: Since your conservatory has radiators in it has been considered as part of the treated area in this assessment. Normally it is not recommended to heat conservatories since they tend to be high heat loss areas. Generally they are designed to be used when the sun has heated them. In your case the roof and high levels of glazing make it an area of heavy loss in the model. However, the walls are of cavity construction and there is good double glazing and filled cavity walls between the conservatory and main house so you can consider it a little separately. But this is too complicated for the model to reflect. \\n\\nBecause of the above consideration with regard to the conservatory and because bungalows are inherently harder to heat high surface to volume ratio it is difficult to get the model to reduce the emissions by 80 percent without removing the conservatory from the heated space. Since you identified this as your most loved room we decided not to do this\\n\\nSince you have just moved in it is not possible to extrapolate a full years gas and electricity consumption from the readings you gave. Therefore there is no comparison for \\\"your bills\\\" in the report.  \\n\\nScenario 1\\n\\nThe first set of measures we propose are fairly simple ones that can be carried out quickly and relatively cheaply, with some immediate benefits. It may be that you carry these\\nout as the first step of a bigger programme, or as part of a bigger program of works. Most of these can be carried out independently of other works. We suggest you get someone in to carry out basic draught proofing measures. This will include the front door and the ground floor along with blocking up any unnecessary holes through walls. The full insulation of the loft has been included here. We would advise carrying out the necessary roof work before insulating the ceiling and adding storage space if required and an insulated loft hatch.  In this scenario we recommend replacing all the windows with uPVC type with A rated uPVC double glazed units, this is a relatively cheap option. Currently about half the light fittings in your house have low energy bulbs in. It would be good to do this throughout. \\n\\nWe recommend you have the chimney with the gas fire flue in it capped and filled with insulation such as vermiculite. \\n\\nThis scenario reduces annual space heat demand by over 10 percent with overall CO2 emissions reduced by a similar amount.\\n\\nScenario 2\\n\\nThis scenario is designed to suggest the extent to which you personally might go in a moderately deep retrofit of the property. It doesn\'t mean that you necessarily have to do it all or do it to the level suggested here but it gives and idea of what might be possible. It\'s assumed that you would do the loft spaces as in Scenario 1. \\n\\nWe have not suggested you have external wall insulation added here. The presence of cavity wall insulation means your walls do not currently perform that badly. External insulation would certainly improve them but the benefit vs cost is less compelling than if the walls were solid. Also you have suggested you may not be open to changing the appearance of your house externally, which would be necessary to achieve this. If you changed your mind, it would be possible to add external wall insulation at a later date. \\n\\nWindows and doors - Here the windows are all replaced with triple glazed units with a performance twice that of those proposed in scenario 1. We have suggested uPVC as they are much cheaper than timber and the age and character of the property means they would not look out of place. Timber triple glazed are available but at significantly greater cost - though you may prefer these for aesthetic or environmental impact. See the Carbon Coop\'s windows information sheet for a discussion of some of the pros and cons. \\n\\nFloors - We have assumed it would be possible to insulate under both the main house and the conservatory. Despite the sloping nature of the land there does appear to be reasonably good crawl height under the joists. For this reason we consider it a better option than replacing with a solid floor.\\n\\nRoofs - In addition to insulating the loft as in scenario1 we suggest replacing the polycarbonate roof in the conservatory with an properly insulated structure. Since you enjoy this space it makes sense to make it perform well thermally without compromising the qualities that you enjoy too much. This measure in the report does not allow for teh extra cost of replacing the roof altogether only for the insulation so that needs to be considered too.\\n\\nThe works needed for the above are moderately significant and would create quite a bit of disturbance. In some cases they can be achieved while the property is occupied.. The model indicates that doing everything as suggested could reduce the space heating demand for the property very significantly to 56 kWhm2 at a 20 degree internal target temperature. This represents a drop of more than 50 percent from your current situation. Emissions have dropped by around 40 percent. \\n\\nAs stated early these measures could be done in different ways to different levels. But some mix of all of them would deliver a good retrofit that would meet your needs. \\n\\nScenario 3\\n\\nThis scenario is aimed at meeting the 2050 UK government 80 emissions reduction target but does fall just short of that for reasons explained above. \\nIt includes the measures in scenario 2. In addition the external walls have now been insulated externally. The appearance of the property could be maintained by opting for a brick slip cladding rather than render finish - though achieving a satisfactory finish that really looks like brick may result in additional cost. This work should be done in conjunction with windows to ensure the best thermal performance. \\n\\nA solar electric array has been added to the roof. Super Advanced draft-proofing measures have also been applied - this would require more care to be taken in measures like window installs and floor insulation - but may also need \\n\\nThese additional measures further reduce space heating demand to 25 kWh\\/m2.per year at a 20 degree target internal temperature - which is comparable if not better than much new-build housing. \\n%\\n\",\"assessors_name\":\"Assessor\",\"assessors_biography\":\"\",\"houseimage\":\"\",\"1a_name\":\"A house\",\"1a_addressline1\":\"in a street\",\"1a_addressline2\":\"\",\"1a_addressline3\":\"\",\"1a_towncity\":\"a city\",\"1a_postcode\":\"a postcode\",\"1a_localauthority\":\"A local authority\",\"1a_conservationarea\":\"No\",\"1a_listedbuilding\":false,\"1b_housetype\":\"detached\",\"1b_bedrooms\":3,\"1b_agesap\":\"1950-1966\",\"1b_age\":\"unknown\",\"2a_tenure\":\"owner-occupied\",\"2a_lengthofoccupancy\":\"Less than 12 months\",\"2b_adults18to65\":1,\"2b_adults65plus\":1,\"2b_childrenlessthan5\":\"\",\"2b_children5to17\":\"\",\"2b_pets\":\"no\",\"2b_health\":\"no\",\"3a_roomthermostat\":20,\"3a_roomthermostatcomment\":\"not here long enough\",\"3a_TRVs\":1,\"3a_programmer\":false,\"3a_timer\":1,\"3a_cylinderthermostat\":false,\"3a_zonecontrol\":false,\"3a_boilerenergymanager\":false,\"3a_intelligentthermostats\":false,\"3a_remotecontrol\":false,\"3a_TRVs_comment\":\"\",\"3a_programmer_comment\":\"\",\"3a_timer_comment\":\"\",\"3a_cylinderthermostat_comment\":\"\",\"3a_zonecontrol_comment\":\"\",\"3a_boilerenergymanager_comment\":\"\",\"3a_intelligentthermostats_comment\":\"\",\"3a_remotecontrol_comment\":\"\",\"3a_habitable_rooms_not_heated\":0,\"3b_showertype\":\"Mixer direct\",\"3b_showerrating\":\"\",\"3b_shower_frequency\":1,\"3b_shower_flowrate\":\"\",\"3b_bath_frequency\":\"\",\"3b_kitchen_taps_num\":1,\"3b_utility_room_taps_num\":\"\",\"3b_bathroom_1_taps_num\":1,\"3b_bathroom_2_taps_num\":1,\"3b_kitchen_taps_type\":\"No energy saving feature\",\"3b_utility_room_taps_type\":\"No energy saving feature\",\"3b_bathroom_1_taps_type\":\"No energy saving feature\",\"3b_bathroom_2_taps_type\":\"No energy saving feature\",\"3c_extract_vents\":1,\"3c_intake_vents\":false,\"3c_trickle_vents\":false,\"3c_trickle_vents_comment\":\"\",\"3c_intake_vents_comment\":\"\",\"3c_extract_vents_comment\":3,\"3c_airbricks_comment\":\"yes\",\"reading_temp1\":22.6,\"reading_humidity1\":49,\"reading_temp2\":22.6,\"reading_humidity2\":49,\"4b_drying_outdoorline\":1,\"4b_drying_indoorrack\":\"\",\"4b_drying_airingcupboard\":\"\",\"4b_drying_tumbledryer\":\"1 emergency\",\"4b_drying_washerdryer\":\"\",\"4b_drying_radiators\":\"\",\"4b_drying_electricmaiden\":\"\",\"5a_past_location\":\"\",\"5a_past_severity\":\"\",\"5a_past_howresolved\":\"\",\"5a_current_location\":\"Roof structure\",\"5a_current_severity\":\"medium\",\"5a_current_howresolved\":\"needs resolving\",\"5b_loftconversion\":\"\",\"5b_extension\":\"\",\"5b_insulation\":\"loft insulation, cavities\",\"5b_windows\":\"all windows uPVc DG various ages\",\"5b_heatinghotwater\":\"\",\"5b_other\":\"Conservatory 2005\",\"5c_damp_location\":\"none\",\"5c_damp_severity\":\"\",\"5c_damp_duration\":\"\",\"5c_condensation_location\":\"south bedroom\",\"5c_condensation_severity\":\"mild\",\"5c_condensation_duration\":\"\",\"5c_mould_location\":\"\",\"5c_mould_severity\":\"\",\"5c_mould_duration\":\"\",\"6a_temperature_winter\":\"Too cold\",\"6a_temperature_summer\":\"Just right\",\"6a_airquality_winter\":\"Just right\",\"6a_airquality_summer\":\"Just right\",\"6a_draughts_summer\":\"Just right\",\"6a_draughts_winter\":\"Just right\",\"6a_problem_locations\":\"Dining room, master bedroom\",\"6b_daylightamount\":\"Too little\",\"6b_artificallightamount\":\"Just right\",\"6b_problem_locations\":\"Lounge\",\"6c_noise_comment\":\"none\",\"6d_unloved_rooms\":\"no\",\"6d_favourite_room\":\"conservatory\",\"7a_occupancylength\":\"Long term, more than 10 years\",\"7a_occupancylength_comment\":\"\",\"7a_lifestylechange_comment\":\"no\",\"7a_homeconversion_comment\":\"no\",\"7b_carbon\":1,\"7b_money\":3,\"7b_comfort\":2,\"7b_airquality\":\"\",\"7b_modernisation\":\"\",\"7b_health\":\"\",\"7c_local\":\"y\",\"7c_natural\":\"\",\"7c_performance\":\"\",\"7c_hitech\":\"\",\"7c_health\":\"\",\"7c_moisture\":\"\",\"7c_lowmaintenance\":\"\",\"7d_externally\":\"maybe\",\"7d_internally\":\"yes\",\"7e_disruption_level\":\"Move out for a few days\\/week\",\"7e_disruption_comment\":\"\",\"7f_timescale\":\"Within the next 3 -

You should consider carrying out works to these areas at the same time, for example by re-roofing ideally extending the roof over the insulation, or replacing windows and doors so they can be moved into the insulation layer.
