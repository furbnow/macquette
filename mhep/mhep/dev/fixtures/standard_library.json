Junctions with the roof, windows and doors and the floor need careful attention. Gaps in the insulation reduce its effectiveness and create risks to the building structure. You should consider carrying out works to these areas at the same time, for example by re-roofing (ideally extending the roof over the insulation), or replacing windows and doors so they can be moved into the insulation layer. There will be a requirement for scaffolding, which may need permission from neighbours. The current condition of the wall may affect the specification, and repairs may be required before external wall insualtion can be applied. Alternative finishes - tile hanging, timber cladding, rainscreen etc - may be possible, but will probably increase costs. The cavity within the wall should be filled (if not already) and quality of this should be checked to avoid risk of thermal bypass - where cavity acts as chimney, increasing heatloss through convection.

Insulating will change the conditions of the sub-floor space, which may increase the risk of damp and rot. The existing condition of the sub-floor and floor joists should be carefully inspected, and it should be ensured that an adequate amount of ventilation is provided to the sub-floor - by un-blocking air-bricks or introducing new ones. If joists are thinner than insulation, may be necessary to under-draw floor with more rigid (but still breathable) insulating board. ",
