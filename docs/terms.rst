U-value
-------

The u-value of a material is a measure of its effectiveness as an
insulator.  From the `Designing Buildings wiki <https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/U-values>`_:

   U-values are measured in watts per square metre per kelvin (W/(mÂ²K)).
   For example, a double glazed window with a U-value of 2.8, for every
   degree difference in temperature between the inside and outside of the
   window, 2.8 watts will be transmitted every square metre.

Lower u-values are better insulators!
