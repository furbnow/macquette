Websites
--------
Websites are mhep.carbon.coop and mhep-staging.carbon.coop.
To log in you will have to give yourself the right permissions on auth0 - there are some roles set up for this, both for basic access but also staff/superuser access.
Locally it's the same as the hub, there's an env var you can change to switch between Auth0 and not.
