Process for importing old MHEP assessments
==========================================

- Get a copy of the original report or data to check against
- Get the data from S3, unpack it
- Load the sql file into a new DB in mysql
- find the assessment in the assessments table
- copy it out (this wonâ€™t include images)
- make a new assessment in HRP, go to import/export
- open the console and try to copy paste the JSON

you will run into errors.
