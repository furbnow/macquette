Heating systems
---------------

We don't integrate with the PCDB for boiler efficiency data because it's got a spurious degree of accuracy.  Most condensing boilers in practice probably fail to reach their theoretical efficiency in any case because they are never used cold enough to condense and as such there is no advantage to collecting this data, and almost all modern boilers have a theoretical efficiency of around 90% in lab tests.

Differences from SAP
--------------------

Our differences from SAP tend to be where the 'regulatory building' (Part L) differs from the actual building - so the way SAP deals with occupancy, overshading, and appliances.
